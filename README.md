# CSE151b_Competition
Final_model.ipynb is the file that produces the output with best kaggle score. \n
Please also download the final_model.pt and put it in same directory as the .ipynb \n
How to run: 
1. run everything before the block that actually trains the model (because parsing test file needs information about the training set)
2. run everything after the block that actually trains the model
